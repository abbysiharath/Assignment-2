    <h2>What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?</h2>
    <p>We all have different ideal jobs that are associated with the IT industry. Each of
        the groups' ideal job
        positions have distinct roles, yet common elements with each other. As represented on the table,
        there
        are many common key requirements and skills needed to be accepted into the specific field. E.g.
        Everyone
        has a common element of Microsoft windows. The most common skill required in the IT industry is
        needing
        the skill to use Microsoft windows. Although there are many common elements between the group’s
        positions,
        there are many different elements as well. E.g., Skills such as marketing, network creations
        etc. are not
        common elements within our ideal jobs, as the jobs do not require those specifically needed
        skills. </p>
    <h2>How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h2>
    <p>Our group's career paths are pretty similar. Although each person is vying for a
        distinct position, they share similar talents and qualities. We discovered as a group that core
        abilities such as the ability to utilize Microsoft and programming knowledge are interchangeable
        in the IT business.</p>
    <p>After looking at the skills and requirements across our ideal jobs, it can be
        found that there is a common preference
        for soft skills such as communication, time management and ability to work in a team
        environment. In regards to hard
        skills, we all need experience in Microsoft (windows, excel etc.) to begin with. As the jobs
        become more specific they
        require knowledge in java, html, completion of certificates (CCNA) and of course multiple years
        of experience before
        being able to acquire a full time position. The suitable tasks for the group span from data and
        system management to
        programming. As a front-end developer, you must be fluent in coding languages such as HTML,
        JavaScript, and CSS. This
        may be different for the work of a digital strategist, which demands a stronger understanding of
        marketing. While both
        are IT-related, they are very different occupations with very different tasks and
        responsibilities.</p>
    <p>As for career plans, it seems we’re all working towards completing our program at
        university first, to gain the
        knowledge and skills required for the IT industry as well as those specific to our ideal
        positions. Internships would
        help a lot as we’d gain experience in a workplace and provide an insight into how our lives
        would be in the industry.
        From studying at RMIT we are hoping to learn how to solve, support, troubleshoot, and build
        everything from websites to
        database networks. Participating in work-integrated learning activities will allow us to obtain
        hands-on industry
        experience and build a professional network. Some of us are not set on a future job and are
        keeping an open mind, since
        many skills we learn will be transferrable across most roles in the IT industry, but we are
        hoping by the end of the
        program we’ll be able to choose one that represents emerging technology trends and, of course,
        one that we enjoy.</p>

<h1>IT Work</h1>

  <h2>Zach</h2>
  <br> 
  <br />  

  <p>Zach is an IT (Information Technology) professional that has a YouTube channel called “I.T.CareerQuestions” where he talks about career questions everyone has 
    regarding IT.  </p>


<p>In a video, he talked about his day-to-day work life as an IT professional. Zach works for a hospital as an Information Systems Technician where he helps 
  support people with their devices. Some of the things he does is user account creation, active directory management, group policy management, imaging using
  Microsoft Deployment Toolkit and help service desk ticketing management, which is a help desk software program used to process, manage, and track customer issues. 
  Although this is what he does, he states, “the issues vary, and every day is different, and it can throw you for a complete loop. You can never go to work expecting
  something. A lot of the time there is something that is going to take priority thus why the ticketing system is important as it manages the most critical issues 
  first.” </p>
        
<br>
<p>He also spends a lot of time everywhere. He can be at the service desk, or he goes out into the field which consists of going around to clinics and general 
  facilities to assist with technical issues. For the people he interacts with, there are other IT professionals who do the same job tasks as him and the main 
  interactions are with the general public and hospital workers. This is because he will sometimes constantly answer phone calls for customers as well as going 
  around the facility helping the hospital with technical issues.  </p>
        
<br>
<p>It seems like the most challenging aspect of his IT position is advancing technology, unexpected work, and work priorities. Zach notes that they are a window-based
  environment and are phasing out a lot of their old windows. This indicates that as technology advances, IT professionals need to adapt to the changing environment
  and learn the newer and more advanced technology. It is difficult to go into work and not being able to expect something. Since every day is different and issues
  varies, it is difficult to adapt to the situation, especially when there are many technological/customer issues and constant change of priorities where you cannot
  manage all these issues at the same time, so you must try to go back and forth and get things done. </p>

<h2>Talmage Kelley </h2>
  <br> 
  <br />  

  <p>The video starts with him preparing his breakfast and heading off to his office. He then shows a little office tour. He then explains what he is doing for 
    his company, he is setting up a scanner so the company can scan all the technology on their network. He shows a timelapse of his work. He then must fix problems 
    that he found. He downloads a service straight to a server. He is having trouble with the server and getting the scanner to work. He doesn’t have the hardware 
    for it to work. He must write up a justification for why the business should buy the hardware. </p>

<br>
<p>In the second video he explains the steps on how he got into cyber security. He explains it in multiple steps. He learnt how computers work. He tested himself 
  on the hardware and software. He got a certification in networking. The next step is learning the fundamentals of programming.  He recommends that you learn how 
  to use Linux. This taught him the fundamentals of operating systems. He recommends you get an entry job or an internship. He explains how there are many sections
  of cyber security and that you should specialize in one.  </p>

<br>
<p>Tal needs to monitor the servers to see if they are running well and he needs to install programs onto the servers. He looks for vulnerabilities in his networks
  which he has a lot of trouble with within the video. A lot of his job seems to involve problem solving and googling. In the second video he recommends learning how 
  to google efficiently. He needs to diagnose issues with the servers and then solve them, which he looks all over the internet to try and solve the issue. He makes
  scripts to try and automate some of his work. He also wants to specialize in penetration testing, this can be seen when he tries to find vulnerabilities in the 
  network.  </p>

<br>
<p>He mainly stays in a small office by himself but when he does have to interact with people it would be in meetings or via email. He must write up justifications
  to his managers if he needs them to buy things. He has two seats in front of his desk which means that people come to him, probably for help or to discuss what he 
  needs to do for the company. Other cyber security engineers would discuss things with him as well. He probably doesn’t need to interact with investors as management
  would handle that.   </p>

  <br>
  <p>He spends the majority of his time in his office which is on premises at his work. He has everything he needs in his office and if he doesn’t (like the server 
    in the video) he goes and gets it. He also works from home as well if he is working on projects that he can’t finish at work. He also does his own little projects 
    at home that may help him with his job.  </p>

<br>
<p>The problem-solving aspect of Tal’s work seems quite challenging epically as he discovers as the video goes that installing a scanner into the network won’t be
  as easy as he thinks. He spends many hours trying to get the scanner to work then many more searching for a solution only for him to find at the end of the day 
  that it is a hardware limitation and not something he can fix at the current time.  </p>

<h2>Emilio Aguero </h2>
  <br> 
  <br />  

  <p>Emilio Aguero works as an IT manager. As an IT manager he is the overall management of IT systems of an organisation, and is required to keep checks on the
    health, backup and security of their systems. He ensures the health of servers and networks, that infrastructure is patched and updated and takes control of
    recruitment of staff.   </p>

    <br>
    <p>IT manager Emilio also forms a budget each financial year, outlining the expenditure for that year. This process involves submitting a business case to 
      directors and higher leadership teams. In a case where more budget is required, he will apply for more expenditure, laying out the reasons why it is needed, 
      how it will benefit the organisation and what will happen if it is not acquired. An IT manager is responsible for procurement, that is, getting in contact
      with vendors and third party customers. This involves maintaining a good relationship with various parties to find the most reliable and best deals for 
      resources to support end users as well as the organisation. An IT manager will assign tickets from clients to staff or themself. These tickets operate
      the company’s technology environment, fix issues and attempt to resolve user issues.  </p>

    <br>
    <p>Emilio oversees infrastructure support and tries to ensure both physical and virtual servers are not overloaded nor overloading each other. This calls for 
      the monitoring of traffic and the health of these systems and storage environments.  </p>

    <br>
    <p>Interaction is a vital part of an Emilio’s job. Whether it is towards staff in the office, their own team or mentoring new employees. They are also involved
      in the recruitment of staff and liaise with recruitment companies for this process to go smoothly. An IT manager must be personable and approachable, have
      good relationships with others in the office and ensure their understanding of their roles. In both smaller and larger companies an IT manager are required 
      to report any progress or action plans to directors, also meeting with other teams to inform them on decision and processes to help build their understanding
      of the company. </p>

    <br>
    <p>IT managers are part of the wider team that forms an IT strategy roadmap for an organisation. They try to determine the direction in which a company is
      going and are involved in the bigger decisions in how the business is moving. There is an importance in understanding the culture and people of the company,
      as well as familiarising themselves with the functions of various departments. </p>

    <br>
    <p>As an IT manager, Emilio can work from home as well as the office. This means that his job continues even when he leave the office, which is an aspect that
      he finds challenging in his career. He is on call, constantly checking emails, keeping in touch with vendors and must be ready to act when an emergency arises. 
      Another challenging aspect of this job is that IT managers are often the scapegoat and receive a lot of complaints, particularly from investors and other users.
      So, IT managers like Emilio should be able to keep a cool mindset and act rationally. </p>

    <br>
    <p>Emilio concludes that the roles and responsibilities of an IT manager will vary from company to company, depending on their structure and industry goal. 
      Roles can often be categorised into operations, infrastructure, support and security. In short, IT managers should be up to date with technology and know 
      the best solution for the growth of a business, ensuring the (IT) environment is set up for success in the future. </p>

    <h2>Justin Shin </h2>
    <br> 
    <br />  
  
    <p>Justin Shin is a data analyst in Chicago and when he has meetings he shares what working on , help and timelines of completing activities. He responds emails 
      and check schedules for meetings. For Justin, there are 4 stages of workflow for his data analysis work. The Stages are requirements gathering, querying data, 
      visualizations and validation. </p>
  
      <br>
      <p>For requirements gathering, he usually gathers a meeting with the clients to find out about the requirements. This can be like the demographics such as 
        location, gender and name. It also includes what type of visuals and functions they want, and it also includes what type of data they want. For querying data,
        he uses the software called Sequel to make specific tables and pull data requests. It sometimes requires drawing clauses and specific time intervals within
        the query. Once he builds the data he needs, he starts the visualisation stage. The visualisation stage includes graphs, tables and KPI’s. His last task is
        to validate the data and ensure the data is accurate before giving it to his clients. </p>

      <br>
      <p>It is compulsory for data analysts like Justin to interact with customers whether it is remote or personally. As a data analyst Justin interacts with his
        clients to help gather information for the report or project. In Justin’s case he interacts with his customers remotely although he works at the office and
        at home. He also has to interact with businesses stakeholders such as his boss and manager as they set tasks for him too. He also interacts with his
        co-workers in is company to plan the tasks. </p>

      <br>
      <p>Justin spends most of his time working from home. His daily routine includes his reading a devotional book and mediating. Around 9AM he checks his work
        emails and starts working on any tasks he has. Around 10am he has a meeting with his team and has lunch. He then reviews the dashboards and most of the time 
        is spent on validating the data. He also does sports and running after he finishes work. </p>

<br>
<p>The most challenging part is the requirements gathering as you need to know what the clients want. For the new dashboard, Justin must spend most of his time 
  ensuring that the information transferred from the old dashboard is correct. The data validation is also challenging because without the right data the dashboard 
  can show faulty data, and this would make it useless. If one thing goes wrong and it is linked the whole thing can go wrong. By validating the data, they won’t
  have to do it again as the information for the final project would have already been correct. </p>

    <h2>East Charmer </h2>
    <br> 
    <br />  

    <p>East Charmer is an IT support specialist dealing Data centres. She works alone majority of the time but occasionally goes into the office when there is work 
      to be done there. The video in which East Charmer showcases is her going into the office to show what it is like. 
    </p>

<br>
<p>She takes the train to work which is a 45-minute commute time. She feels like this is the best option as the office is located in downtown Chicago. </p>

<br>
<p>On the day that she was in the office she had a task to replace the nap.app drives as they were broken in the server room and needs to repair all of the 
  replacement disks. She states that nobody was in the office today due to the pandemic and everyone was working from home. Due to the current circumstances most 
  people prefer to work from home as it saves them the commute time whilst most of the workers come in one day a week, usually a Wednesday for the social aspect. </p>

<br>
<p>As an IT support specialist, she must identify what servers have broken drives and is essential to also identify what models they need to be replaced with. 
  The purpose is so that she knows what drives to bring back to the data centre. While this task is simpler East Charmer believes the most challenging aspect of
  her role is security & management, power supply failure, and network & cabling. The last two require her to physically go into the office whilst security & 
  management can be done remotely which is what she spends most of her time doing. </p>

<br>
<p>  
  She spends her day locating the failed drives. This is done by SSH in the controller and typing up “VOL STATUS -F”. This is an easy way to locate them as it
  brings up the broken disks. Once identified she locates them on the rack and swaps them out. By then tying in “DISK SHOW -N” will bring up the newly replaced 
  disks. Her next job is to assign the disk to the new controller and then she is completed the task. 
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>East Charmer had a late lunch as that task took her to 3pm. The last thing she has to do for the day is to ship some laptops that need to be repaired to
    the suppliers. She finished her day around 5:30pm and then prepared for her 45-minute commute home. To conclude the role of an IT support specialist has 
    to deal with physical hardware failures which needs to be dealt with quickly within a business. It is important that it is hardware is working sufficiently 
    as it can result in decreased efficiency which can be a big cost for a company. </p>

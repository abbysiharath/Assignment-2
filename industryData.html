              <h2> Has Our Opinion Changed Regarding Our Ideal Jobs?</h2>
              <br>
              <h4> Daniel </h4>
              <br>
              <p>After analyzing the Burning Glass data, my opinion of my ideal job has slightly changed.
                Currently, I do not have an exact ideal job that I want to pursue, however, I do have some ideas in mind and looking at the Burning Glass data has helped me keep an open mind to other jobs.
                This is because the data has shown many jobs and skills in demand that have attracted my interest into researching, thus has encouraged me to explore many other pathways and not just solely be narrow and pursue one.
                However, although I feel more encouraged to research the other jobs, currently, I am still going to follow my original ideal job but with a broader perspective.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
              <h4> Aaron Still </h4>
              <br>
              <p>My opinion of my ideal job has not changed.
                As there will be a lot of demand for IT system Administrators in the future and the skills I learn are also in demand so even if I don’t get the job the skills, I learn will be transferable and so will be able to get into similar positions.
                Skills like Writing, troubleshooting, and planning are not required for my job but it would make it a lot easier and so I can still learn those skills which would increase my employability and make the workload less demanding. </p>

                <br>
                <br>
              <h4>Pucksuly (Abby) SIharath </h4>
              <br>
              <p>After reviewing the Burning Glass data in relation to our ideal jobs, I am still determined to follow my original path and work towards a career in database administration. A strong future demand for this job is a great encouragement to do so.
                In saying that, looking at the wide set of skills provide the security that if I were to decide in a career change, many skills that I have learned and will learn can be transferrable to other jobs both in and outside the IT industry. </p>

                <br>
                <br>
              <h4> Dylan Adams</h4>
              <br>
              <p>The details indicated in Burning glass data in relation to our job ideas has made me more confident in my choice as a developer.
                This is due to the current demand in the web developing industry. It has a strong demand for the future to come as everything is turning digital.
                The skills such as coding is the number one element in my ideal job as it can take years to learn and can be used in many roles as the digital age beings.
                By perfecting these essential skills as early as possible will help me with employability and allow me to work smarter not harder </p>

          Security and the dependability of the AV systems are also crucial
        elements in deciding whether or not to accept AVs. Even if AVs might
        be safer, what will the economic and social repercussions be if a
        significant incident happens when numerous AVs are compromised?
        Additionally, system breakdowns, in which the computers or algorithms
        that power AVs stop working, may prevent people from operating a
        vehicle at all. It's vital to take into account the fact that society
        has criminal elements. Criminals might be able to hack into AV
        vehicles and seriously harm people and their property. Health and
        accident insurance would be impacted by each of these various
        scenarios. Who is accountable for paying for insurance? Who does that
        money protect? These questions would need to be rethought and new
        policies implemented before AVs can be introduced on any significant
        scale.

        <h2>Individual Reflections</h2>
        <br />        
      
        Overall, I am very happy with Group 1. Communication was well conducted, and everyone was on time with due dates. 
        However, the one thing that could have improved was the meeting show-up rate. Unfortunately, due to commitments and illness this was not always obtainable, 
        but every member did their best to do their part in the assignment. One thing that was surprising was the workload throughout the group. 
        Unlike many groups I have had in the past we each spread it fairly without any objections. I have come to learn many things about group work, 
        with one being the use of Microsoft teams. The experience has been seamless and shows how the use of software can save so much time when working 
        together virtually. I think most people in the group can say that without it, it would have been a struggle regarding file management. 
        <br><br>
        
   
        Our teamwork for this assignment has been particularly good. We have been communicating effectively with each other, which can be seen in teams, 
        and we have been having regular meetings in which everyone in the group participates, which is also shown on teams. If someone cannot make it to the meeting, 
        then we would either try to reschedule or have it without them and then make a list of what we talked about and what they must do. 
        One thing that could improve is that we could have organized our meetings a bit better. We would ask when we were all free and then have a meeting around that.
        Instead, we could make a group calendar or something like that and ask when we are available for a meeting. 
        One thing that surprised me is how fast we were able to get through the work when we managed ourselves efficiently and effectively. 
        One thing I learned about groups is how common it is to get teammates who do not pull their weight. 
        Listening to groups talk in the tutorials about their struggles with other teammates made me realise how lucky I was to get an excellent group 
        that always communicates. 
        <br><br>
        
       
        I enjoyed working with this group because communication was the least of our worries. We were able to form meetings at times that fit our schedules, 
        and we could communicate outside of meetings when we required something to be done or needed some information from each other. 
        We were all able to complete our tasks individually before putting it altogether, but this might have an impact on the cohesiveness of our report. 
        I’m always nervous to work with new people but i found it surprising how well, at least from my perspective, we all worked together. 
        We shared a few laughs along the way which lessened the burden of doing our extremely best work for the assignment. 
        With this, we acknowledged that each of us had other assignments to work on for other classes, so agreed in taking away the pressure of having 
        set deadlines for each task. Our group has common interests, whether that was games or sports, so it was nice to discover our similarities. 
        Towards the last week of working on the assignment some of us could not attend meetings due to work schedules, sickness and other personal reasons, 
        but everyone was understanding and made it easy to reschedule meetings or even work without one. I think our group was able to use MS teams efficiently, 
        we became comfortable with the different files and utilised the various documents well. In regards to GitHub, the log may reflect less work than 
        intended as we didn’t focus much on the formation of the website although it was a big part of the assignment. At the time of writing this reflection 
        i hope over the next few days this will change as some of us will start to input our skills and creativity into the layout of the website. 
        <br><br>
     
        Everything worked well. Abby had great host skills. Daniel and Dylan had great design skills and Aaron had good feedback skills. 
        Daniel, Dylan and Aaron had really great ideas for the project. The thing that took us the longest was project ideas we though most of ideas 
        were complicated so we came up with a new one. Sometimes we struggled with finding a time that was available for everyone. 
        We had a really great start-up as we meet during the first week lecture and just added a group and added new members after. 
        I was surprises that our group bonded rally well even though we didn’t know each other beforehand and everyone is very responsive with their 
        communication in teams. I learnt that groups make everything more fun and easier and that you can know your team members more well using 
        activities sin the assignment. The GitHub activity was pretty good, and my team members sites look interesting, and we all had unique sites 
        design but for assignment 2 we are planning to keep same formats for all. Surprisingly we had a lot of things in common for our ideal jobs and 
        some of us play the same games. 
        <br><br>
 
        Everyone made the effort to attend group meetings. Even though there were many times where an unfortunate situation has occurred for our group members, 
        such as sickness, unavailability etc. We all made the effort to rearrange two meetings per week Our groups meetings were productive where we discussed 
        the project and how we should tackle the task down. Many ideas, discussions, and feedback helped us progress the assignment efficiently and effectively. 
        It is common for many groups to have people that are not contributing to work, discussions, meetings etc. Fortunately, the group is hard working where we
        all have the common goal on attempting to ace this assignment, so everyone was contributing as much as they could. Our meetings were productive to where,
        once our discussion has ended, we were always in the specific range for the length of the meeting which indicates the effort that was put in by everyone. 
        The work was thoroughly completed by everyone, where every detail was included, or the specific word count was reached. The group was open to multiple 
        opinions and ideas during announcement/meetings, which made settling on an idea amazingly easy as everyone respected each other. The work progress was a 
        bit slow. Ideally hoping some of the tasks would be completed and submitted quicker. Some meetings the discussion was not too engaging and did not progress
        too much. A lot of us have quite different schedules, so we all had to reschedule meetings because everyone's contribution is needed. I found surprising 
        that everyone put lots of effort into this  assignment because a lot of the times there are few groups where everyone equally contributes. I found 
        interesting that the group was remarkably diverse in personality, and that our ideal jobs were similar yet different. We all took our education seriously
        which was impressive.

        <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
        <br />        
        <p>
        <ul>
        
          <li>A large key point of how well the group worked together was the effective communication. 
          Each member was responsive and made a clear effort to attend meetings. 
          Those meetings were regular (aimed for two per week), and when they weren’t it was relatively easy to reschedule as there was 
          an acknowledgement of other commitments - other classes, work schedules or personal reasons. 
          The use of meeting notes also kept members up to date if they had missed all or part of a meeting. 
          Some meetings were not very engaging when members were working on their own tasks, but they were mostly productive. 
          For example meetings were expected to be quite short in duration but would often go over time, so this displays the group’s commitment and efforts. 
          <br><br>
        
          <li>Each group member displayed their strengths as part of teamwork - leadership, hosting of meetings, skills in design and creativity 
          were shown throughout brainstorming. Ability to provide feedback was also exhibited by various members and this was a key part 
          of the discussions and progression through the assignment. Together the group tackled the assignment section by section, 
          agreeing on what was expected and how they’d progress through each task and ultimately, the assignment. 
          The group was respective of eachother so made it easy to settle on ideas when everyone was open to and accepting of multiple opinions.
          <br><br>
        
          <li>There were some meetings which lacked attendance due to varying reasons. 
          Nevertheless each members did their best to contribute to the assignment regardless of meetings. 
          There could have been more effectively scheduling of the group meetings - using a group calendar to show availabilities 
          might work but it was difficult to find an extension for that.  
          <br><br>
        
          <li>Some of the group agree that the progress was a bit slow. They thought it was ideal some of the tasks would be completed 
          and submitted a bit sooner than they were. It also might have been a good idea to start on the project idea a bit earlier. 
          The group decided to take on a new concept, with aid from the teacher, but this section of the assignment was only focused on 
          towards the last few days before submission. 
          <br><br>
        
          <li>It was great that members were capable of completing tasks entirely individually, but this may impact the cohesiveness of the report. 
          Additionally, the Github log may reflect lack of participation on the website formation, hopefully this changes from now until submission of assignment. 
          <br><br>
        
          <li>The group found surprising how evenly the workload was allocated, and efficiently too. 
          Listening to class discussions members realised how fortunate they were with the group formation, 
          finding that other groups had struggles with communication and other issues, things this group did not particularly have difficulty with.  
          <br><br>
        
          <li>Use of Microsoft Teams was a life saver for the assignment, without it file use and management would have been a hassle, and it reaffirmed 
          that use of softwares is incredibly beneficial when working in a team, especially virtually.

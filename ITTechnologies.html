        <h2>Clouds, services, servers</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          ‘Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including
          servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and
          intelligence—over the Internet’ (Microsoft Azure, 2022). This allows
          consumers to keep their files on the “cloud” and not on hard drives so
          that there is less of a chance of the files being lost. The most
          popular cloud computing service and the best example is Amazon Web
          Services. This gives consumers the tools to do whatever they want with
          cloud computing. They can create their own database, get online
          storage, create web sites and apps, create servers, and even tools to
          create machine learning and there’s so much more. There are multiple
          reasons as to why so many people are using cloud computing. It is cost
          effective as it is easier to get another company to host your files as
          it would be very expensive to house all the hardware. This also allows
          multiple people to use the files and not just one person. Cloud
          computing can also be more secure as there are many processes in place
          to stop your data being stolen. It is also very fast as massive
          amounts of data can be accessed within seconds. Data is easily backed
          up onto cloud services which means that no one will be inconvenienced
          by losing their work as they can easily get it back. There are a large
          variety of uses of cloud computing. It is quick and easy to create
          websites and apps using cloud computing as Microsoft has multiple
          “cloud-native” tools to help. Streaming services such as Netflix and
          Amazon Prime, Twitch, and YouTube are another example of cloud
          computing as people can access these streaming websites from anywhere,
          they have an internet connection.

          Applications can be delivered over the internet such as Microsoft
          Office, where that allows you to access the Microsoft office apps from
          online. Cloud services host these apps and keep them up to date and
          keep them secure. Data can be easily analysed across departments at a
          business as everyone will have access to them from their workstations
          and using Amazon Web Services you can create Artificial Intelligence
          to help sift through the data. There are 3 types of cloud services,
          public clouds, Private and Hybrid. Public is when a third-party
          service provider like Drop Box or Microsoft Azure owns a server, and
          they allow others to use them. Private cloud is when the cloud
          services are used by a single business, usually the cloud is located
          on the premises of the business. Hybrid cloud is when these two are
          combined. Cloud computing is still a new technology, so the focus is
          currently to improve further everything that is already has. Cloud
          Service Providers (CSP) want to increase storage capacity as data is
          getting bigger and bigger. Programs are becoming larger and more
          complex and so CSP’s will need to create programs that are far more
          user-friendly and allow for more customisation so that it doesn’t be
          impossible for people to create things using the cloud. Data on clouds
          is currently secure but they won’t be unless CSP’s continue to
          maintain them and ensure that their security protocols are up to date.
          Eventually most hardware will be accessible through the clouds and so
          the demand for certain hardware will be reduced, which saves costs.
          What is currently holding back cloud computing is the internet. As the
          internet improves and becomes more powerful so will cloud computing
          and everything tied to it like machine learning and ai which requires
          a lot of computing power to use which can be provided through cloud
          service providers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Just about everyone from businesses to individuals are affected by the
          improvements of cloud computing and they are affected in a good way.
          For business they can reduce costs by getting a third-party cloud
          service provider to host their servers and store all their data. They
          also save on space as they don’t need to keep massive servers on them.
          They also save on electricity as they don’t need as much hardware and
          eventually, they will be able to access virtual machines over the
          cloud which means there won’t be as much IT infrastructure and
          software installation done. A lot of tasks will be automated for them
          as Ai and Machine learning will be improved. Jobs such as data analyst
          will be done by computers instead of humans. Everyday consumers will
          have access to even faster cloud services, and they will get farm more
          storage options at an affordable price as the market is so
          competitive. However, some jobs may be made redundant through the
          advancement of cloud computing. Jobs such as administration will be
          automated and so there will be no need for any human interaction. It
          will be the same for data analyst as Ai will be able to do that job.
          Anything that involves processing information will be done through
          cloud services. Even package delivery will be done by drones and not
          humans and so some workers will have to adapt and learn how to use the
          drones to keep their job. But some jobs will be created by the
          improvement of the cloud. Jobs such as cloud administrator who manages
          the clouds infrastructure, Cloud Network Engineers maintain the cloud
          services on a companies’ network, and a cloud consultant who provide
          knowledge and guidance on companies looking to adopt certain types of
          cloud services. <br />

          Cloud services is something that we all already use in our day to day
          lives. Services that we all use are email, Netflix, Spotify, YouTube,
          Amazon etc. I use cloud services nearly every day for entertainment. I
          use Netflix for movies and TV shows and Spotify for music and I use
          google drive to back up my work. I use canvas to gain access to my
          classes and all my work as well as to communicate with others. Pretty
          much every aspect of my life involves cloud service. I can’t fully
          rely on cloud services for everything as my internet is not as good as
          it’s always cutting out, so I am unable to use apps such as Microsoft
          office as I might lose my work if the internet cuts out. I can’t use
          the game streaming feature on the X Box Gamepass as the delay is
          massive. My brother collects DVDs as it's frustrating when the movie
          is buffering. All my family and friends use cloud services every
          single day. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t use YouTube and Netflix.
          My parents use cloud services whenever they use online banking or
          whenever they work from home. Most of use machine learning without
          even knowing, websites have ads that are tailored perfectly for us,
          and our phones can even learn our usage patterns and learn when to
          charge our phones and streaming services are always recommending
          movies for us. The data that is taken from us from websites and apps
          are all put in cloud servers for it to be studied later to find out
          more about what our interests is. Whether we know it or not cloud
          computing is a part of our everyday lives. It can be as big as YouTube
          and as small as texting family or friends.

        <h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Autonomous vehicles are those that are capable of sensing their
          environment and driving safely with little to no human input. They are
          developed with the main purpose of reducing accidents on roads and are
          aimed to be widely distributed to the public in the next few years.
          <br />
          <br />
          All standard Tesla vehicles include autopilot features. These cars are
          capable of suggesting routes for effective travel, and even
          automatically navigates the driver based on their destination. Users
          can summon their Tesla and it will navigate itself through the most
          complex of environments to meet them. These are just a few examples of
          tasks current autonomous vehicles are capable of, and is only a sneak
          peak of what they can be programmed to do in the future. <br />
          <br />
          Only if AVs (Autonomous Vehicles) have the ability to make decisions
          will they be deemed autonomous. Algorithms are the foundation of
          autonomous vehicle technology. An algorithm decides what to do when
          specific circumstances arise. For instance, when a person crosses the
          street, the algorithm must first recognise a moving item, then
          identify what it is, and last decide whether to slow down or guide the
          car in a different direction to prevent a collision. To accomplish
          this, the algorithm must be taught and programmed. People are in
          charge of programming the AV's fundamental rules; they determine what
          the AV will perform. The algorithm is trained using data and tested in
          actual scenarios to determine how well these rules work. The results
          are analyzed by people who adjust the algorithm so that it makes
          better decisions. <br />
          <br />
          Making moral choices will be necessary, for example, when deciding who
          will perish in a collision: the driver of the car or the pedestrian
          who was crossing the street (called self-sacrifice). How will an
          autonomous vehicle make the split-second decision to plough into a
          little toddler or two elderly folks at a high speed? Which of these
          lives is more valuable, and is it possible to train the algorithm to
          choose which one? We asked the programmers who are actively developing
          these algorithms how they would handle these circumstances. They said
          they wouldn't support rules requiring selflessness because they would
          discourage users and investors from purchasing autonomous vehicles.

      <div class="text-2-1">Security and the dependability of the AV systems are also crucial
        elements in deciding whether or not to accept AVs. Even if AVs might
        be safer, what will the economic and social repercussions be if a
        significant incident happens when numerous AVs are compromised?
        Additionally, system breakdowns, in which the computers or algorithms
        that power AVs stop working, may prevent people from operating a
        vehicle at all. It's vital to take into account the fact that society
        has criminal elements. Criminals might be able to hack into AV
        vehicles and seriously harm people and their property. Health and
        accident insurance would be impacted by each of these various
        scenarios. Who is accountable for paying for insurance? Who does that
        money protect? These questions would need to be rethought and new
        policies implemented before AVs can be introduced on any significant
        scale. <br />
        <br />
        AVs such as those being developed and tested by large organisations
        like Waymo and Tesla are currently at level 4 out of 5, meaning they
        are highly autonomous. Most of these vehicles are pending approval
        with innumerable regulations, and must of course pass many tests to
        ensure they will not pose any danger to drivers, other road users and
        the environment. It is expected that AVs at level 5 - fully autonomous
        - can be on roads as soon as three years from now, with some vehicles
        having no requirement for either a steering wheel or accelerator.
        <br />
        <br />
        What is the likely impact? Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the
        potential to have a tremendous influence on society by enabling
        driverless mobility for a very diverse group of individuals, including
        those who are now unable to drive due to physical, mental, or other
        impairments. Seniors, those with disabilities, and perhaps even young
        children would have easier access to independent commuting. Because
        there are less traffic congestion, AVs can significantly shorten
        travel times. Additionally, anyone travelling in the AV who don't
        drive can be productive while doing so because it is a much safer
        vehicle. Finally, users may use their phones without endangering
        others on the road or themselves! <br />
        <br />
        While many employment may change, many will also likely be lost since
        the transportation sector may no longer require human drivers. People
        who make a living driving cars, trucks, and buses may find themselves
        without employment if these vehicles begin to drive themselves. Next,
        think about all the managerial, support, and supervisory personnel
        employed by those drivers; these positions will likewise no longer be
        required. Jobs like taxi drivers may inevitably go away, but other
        positions like police officers may change since there won't be a need
        to issue tickets for speeding and parking. <br />
        <br />
        By enhancing how cars brake and accelerate, AV technology can decrease
        energy consumption while reducing emissions by 90%. The majority of
        driverless cars on the road today are already entirely electric.
        However, users would still be indirectly producing emissions if the
        car's battery charge isn't totally supplied by renewable energy,
        albeit significantly less so than a gasoline engine. When driving, AVs
        consume substantially less fuel and energy than a vehicle piloted by a
        human. When travelling at a high speed, braking heavily, then
        reaccelerating rapidly, the majority of the fuel is used. By
        eliminating these components from algorithms, programmers are reducing
        the amount of fuel burned, battery power used, and air pollution
        produced. <br />
        <br />
        How will this affect you? As AVs (Autonomous Vehicles) are expected to
        be safer than vehicles with human drivers, the chance of my family or
        friends getting into an accident will be reduced. Safety is always of
        importance in our lives. It’s always frustrating to see car accidents
        that occur from human drivers unable to pay attention to their
        surroundings, or are simply incapable of driving safely and according
        to the rules of the road. Use of AVs will avoid accidents influenced
        by these reasons and make the roads a safer place for everyone,
        including my family and friends. <br />
        <br />
        As a current student, the use of public transport is inevitably a part
        of my daily routine, whether it is to class, to friends, dinner or to
        get groceries. Additionally, I occasionally also drive my own vehicle
        to the station before further catching public transport. Public
        transport might become redundant, but that will be because AVs will
        become cheaper, safer in terms of less accidents, and also could be
        more comfortable in terms of privacy and hygiene. Autonomous vehicles
        could be a way to maintain economic activity in the event of a global
        pandemic while lowering the risk of viral transmission. <br />
        <br />
        As my parents and others around me get older, they will slowly lose
        the inability to drive in a manner which is safe for themselves and
        other road users. If AVs are widely introduced to the public, these
        people will not have so much of a restriction on their mobility if
        their driving abilities are a key factor in not being able to complete
        daily tasks and travel varying distances, to visit family on the other
        side of Melbourne for example. Besides, prices of fuel have soared
        over the past few months and don’t seem like they’ll return back to
        “normal” anytime soon. The lack of costs associated with AVs
        definitely appeals especially to those that need to travel long
        distances to work and family.</div>

        <h2>
          Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies
        </h2>
        <br>

        

        <p>Blockchain and technology is an upcoming technology which has become popularly widespread amongst society and rivalling the traditional bank network. It is a type of shared database that differs from a traditional database in the way it stores its information. The idea is that it stores data in blocks which are linked together via cryptography. If new data has come in it will go into a fresh block in which once it is fille it will chain itself onto the previous block.  
          As of right now the information stored is commonly ledgers transactions to which it may use different types of information in the future. The idea is that it is used in a decentralised way so that nobody has control over it, which is why there has been an uproar from the government and banks. However, the downside to this is that the transactions are immutable meaning that once they are recorded anybody can view them and cannot be undone. The most common transactions will be with certain tokens which have a monetary value. Much like the stock market these tokens increase and decrease depending on market supply and volume. The two most popular forms of tokens use a mechanism called proof-of-work & proof of stake. Without going into too much detail the benefit of POS makes it much more appealing to consumers over POW. The benefits include a lower energy consumption due the elimination of mining and instead staking which allows investors to invest into a project to which they are rewarded. This is usually with an annual percentage likewise to a dividend. This is why banks are not happy with the decentralised finance as staking rewards can be up to 30% pa which is more appealing to a consumer over the traditional 1-3% of the banks. 
          Many say the possibilities of blockchain are endless. An example of this is the widespread popularity of NFT’s (Non fungible tokens), which took off like crazy. The idea was to sell digital assets that people had created for a price. It was much compared to contemporary artwork with the highest being sold for $69.3 million. Within the next few years, I believe we will see many projects come up like NFT’s which may be a success and change the way we interact with our finances on a day to day basis. The other benefits we may see are faster transactions with tokens such as Solana already outperforming companies such as PayPal currently doing 50,0000 a second. Another aspect which may take affect is the form of digital identify. This would allow consumers to skip KYC processes resulting in the ability to buy high value assets such as a house. This would shape the way we buy things in the future and may incline people to take out loans through companies such as Binance rather than the bank as it is easier to identify yourself and have more competitive borrowing rates.  
          The reason that this is possible is due to the new projects that are being created. Many believe that crowdfunding is the new way to finance especially in the crypto space which allows starts to gain capital quickly. This leads to thousands of companies trying to solve problems within decentralised finance, in which companies such as open sea take advantage of by using the Ethereum framework as their main currency.</p>

      <div class="text-3-1">The current problem we face with this technology is called the blockchain trilemma. These beliefs indicated that companies can only satisfy two of the given three benefits. The three that companies are trying to satisfy are decentralization, security, & scalability. It is important that companies satisfy security the most to protect against hackers. As many of them are decentralized networks it can be very easy for them to get away with theft. 
        The focus is to increase higher security across all networks as blockchain is becoming an emerging technology. Another likely change is legislation across many countries, with countries such as the Central African Republic now using Bitcoin as their official currency. There have also been some countries such as Nepal who have banned it as a currency. The other change being made rapidly is the implementation of tax in certain countries. Australia was one of the quickest countries to implement this being that all profits are now subject to capital gain tax. 
        The people affected most are the ones who live in these countries. Those who live in a country were Bitcoin is the official country are now forced to comply with the standards. Similarly, those who were invested and did not require to pay taxes now have to comply with the tax rulings etc. The other main party affected is the government and banks. They are now not fully in control of money like they once were which is causing them to make changes to take control back. 
        He implementation of blockchain & cryptocurrencies has created many more jobs such as engineers, developers and many more. Similarly, it has also replaced many current jobs. These are companies that use payment processes and also companies that deal with a lot of paperwork. 
        This will affect me in a positive way as it will eliminate time consuming processes. It also has created jobs in the field that I am going into, being software development allowing more job opportunities for me. It also allows me to send money to whoever I want, quickly and with minimal fees. This differs from a bank which can take 2-3 business days to receive money at a high fee. When it comes to me buying a house, I may be able to get a cheaper monthly repayment as well which will allow me to spend my money elsewhere. 
        When it comes to my day-to-day life, I will be able to access all records digitally. This will help against fraud and alteration. Another aspect is decentralized social platforms which allows users to express their opinion without any consequences. In hindsight it will protect my privacy meaning I won’t be able to be tracked based on my recent activities. 
        Depending on the person this could be seen as a positive due to the elimination of the tendinous processes, however for someone older it can be seen as a negative impact. As they are not experienced with technology, they may struggle to adopt practices that may become compulsory in the future. If they do not have a phone and rely on physical cash, they will not be able to do any of these things which may force them to get a phone, or some form of digital identity otherwise forced to go homeless.

    <h1>Aaron Still - Clouds, services, servers</h1>

    <p>
      ‘Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers,
      storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over
      the Internet’ (Microsoft Azure, 2022). This allows consumers to keep their
      files on the “cloud” and not on hard drives so that there is less of a
      chance of the files being lost. The most popular cloud computing service
      and the best example is Amazon Web Services. This gives consumers the
      tools to do whatever they want with cloud computing. They can create their
      own database, get online storage, create web sites and apps, create
      servers, and even tools to create machine learning and there’s so much
      more. There are multiple reasons as to why so many people are using cloud
      computing. It is cost effective as it is easier to get another company to
      host your files as it would be very expensive to house all the hardware.
      This also allows multiple people to use the files and not just one person.
      Cloud computing can also be more secure as there are many processes in
      place to stop your data being stolen. It is also very fast as massive
      amounts of data can be accessed within seconds. Data is easily backed up
      onto cloud services which means that no one will be inconvenienced by
      losing their work as they can easily get it back. There are a large
      variety of uses of cloud computing. It is quick and easy to create
      websites and apps using cloud computing as Microsoft has multiple
      “cloud-native” tools to help. Streaming services such as Netflix and
      Amazon Prime, Twitch, and YouTube are another example of cloud computing
      as people can access these streaming websites from anywhere, they have an
      internet connection. Applications can be delivered over the internet such
      as Microsoft Office, where that allows you to access the Microsoft office
      apps from online. Cloud services host these apps and keep them up to date
      and keep them secure. Data can be easily analysed across departments at a
      business as everyone will have access to them from their workstations and
      using Amazon Web Services you can create Artificial Intelligence to help
      sift through the data. There are 3 types of cloud services, public clouds,
      Private and Hybrid. Public is when a third-party service provider like
      Drop Box or Microsoft Azure owns a server, and they allow others to use
      them. Private cloud is when the cloud services are used by a single
      business, usually the cloud is located on the premises of the business.
      Hybrid cloud is when these two are combined. Cloud computing is still a
      new technology, so the focus is currently to improve further everything
      that is already has. Cloud Service Providers (CSP) want to increase
      storage capacity as data is getting bigger and bigger. Programs are
      becoming larger and more complex and so CSP’s will need to create programs
      that are far more user-friendly and allow for more customisation so that
      it doesn’t be impossible for people to create things using the cloud. Data
      on clouds is currently secure but they won’t be unless CSP’s continue to
      maintain them and ensure that their security protocols are up to date.
      Eventually most hardware will be accessible through the clouds and so the
      demand for certain hardware will be reduced, which saves costs. What is
      currently holding back cloud computing is the internet. As the internet
      improves and becomes more powerful so will cloud computing and everything
      tied to it like machine learning and ai which requires a lot of computing
      power to use which can be provided through cloud service providers. Just
      about everyone from businesses to individuals are affected by the
      improvements of cloud computing and they are affected in a good way. For
      business they can reduce costs by getting a third-party cloud service
      provider to host their servers and store all their data. They also save on
      space as they don’t need to keep massive servers on them. They also save
      on electricity as they don’t need as much hardware and eventually, they
      will be able to access virtual machines over the cloud which means there
      won’t be as much IT infrastructure and software installation done. A lot
      of tasks will be automated for them as Ai and Machine learning will be
      improved. Jobs such as data analyst will be done by computers instead of
      humans. Everyday consumers will have access to even faster cloud services,
      and they will get farm more storage options at an affordable price as the
      market is so competitive. However, some jobs may be made redundant through
      the advancement of cloud computing. Jobs such as administration will be
      automated and so there will be no need for any human interaction. It will
      be the same for data analyst as Ai will be able to do that job. Anything
      that involves processing information will be done through cloud services.
      Even package delivery will be done by drones and not humans and so some
      workers will have to adapt and learn how to use the drones to keep their
      job. But some jobs will be created by the improvement of the cloud. Jobs
      such as cloud administrator who manages the clouds infrastructure, Cloud
      Network Engineers maintain the cloud services on a companies’ network, and
      a cloud consultant who provide knowledge and guidance on companies looking
      to adopt certain types of cloud services. Cloud services is something that
      we all already use in our day to day lives. Services that we all use are
      email, Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, Amazon etc. I use cloud services nearly
      every day for entertainment. I use Netflix for movies and TV shows and
      Spotify for music and I use google drive to back up my work. I use canvas
      to gain access to my classes and all my work as well as to communicate
      with others. Pretty much every aspect of my life involves cloud service. I
      can’t fully rely on cloud services for everything as my internet is not as
      good as it’s always cutting out, so I am unable to use apps such as
      Microsoft office as I might lose my work if the internet cuts out. I can’t
      use the game streaming feature on the X Box Gamepass as the delay is
      massive. My brother collects DVDs as it's frustrating when the movie is
      buffering. All my family and friends use cloud services every single day.
      I don’t know anyone who doesn’t use YouTube and Netflix. My parents use
      cloud services whenever they use online banking or whenever they work from
      home. Most of use machine learning without even knowing, websites have ads
      that are tailored perfectly for us, and our phones can even learn our
      usage patterns and learn when to charge our phones and streaming services
      are always recommending movies for us. The data that is taken from us from
      websites and apps are all put in cloud servers for it to be studied later
      to find out more about what our interests is. Whether we know it or not
      cloud computing is a part of our everyday lives. It can be as big as
      YouTube and as small as texting family or friends.

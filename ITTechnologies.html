        <h2>Clouds, services, servers</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          ‘Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including
          servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and
          intelligence—over the Internet’ (Microsoft Azure, 2022). This allows
          consumers to keep their files on the “cloud” and not on hard drives so
          that there is less of a chance of the files being lost. The most
          popular cloud computing service and the best example is Amazon Web
          Services. This gives consumers the tools to do whatever they want with
          cloud computing. They can create their own database, get online
          storage, create web sites and apps, create servers, and even tools to
          create machine learning and there’s so much more. There are multiple
          reasons as to why so many people are using cloud computing. It is cost
          effective as it is easier to get another company to host your files as
          it would be very expensive to house all the hardware. This also allows
          multiple people to use the files and not just one person. Cloud
          computing can also be more secure as there are many processes in place
          to stop your data being stolen. It is also very fast as massive
          amounts of data can be accessed within seconds. Data is easily backed
          up onto cloud services which means that no one will be inconvenienced
          by losing their work as they can easily get it back. There are a large
          variety of uses of cloud computing. It is quick and easy to create
          websites and apps using cloud computing as Microsoft has multiple
          “cloud-native” tools to help. Streaming services such as Netflix and
          Amazon Prime, Twitch, and YouTube are another example of cloud
          computing as people can access these streaming websites from anywhere,
          they have an internet connection. Applications can be delivered over
          the internet such as Microsoft Office, where that allows you to access
          the Microsoft office apps from online. Cloud services host these apps
          and keep them up to date and keep them secure. Data can be easily
          analysed across departments at a business as everyone will have access
          to them from their workstations and using Amazon Web Services you can
          create Artificial Intelligence to help sift through the data. There
          are 3 types of cloud services, public clouds, Private and Hybrid.
          Public is when a third-party service provider like Drop Box or
          Microsoft Azure owns a server, and they allow others to use them.
          Private cloud is when the cloud services are used by a single
          business, usually the cloud is located on the premises of the
          business. Hybrid cloud is when these two are combined. Cloud computing
          is still a new technology, so the focus is currently to improve
          further everything that is already has. Cloud Service Providers (CSP)
          want to increase storage capacity as data is getting bigger and
          bigger. Programs are becoming larger and more complex and so CSP’s
          will need to create programs that are far more user-friendly and allow
          for more customisation so that it doesn’t be impossible for people to
          create things using the cloud. Data on clouds is currently secure but
          they won’t be unless CSP’s continue to maintain them and ensure that
          their security protocols are up to date. Eventually most hardware will
          be accessible through the clouds and so the demand for certain
          hardware will be reduced, which saves costs. What is currently holding
          back cloud computing is the internet. As the internet improves and
          becomes more powerful so will cloud computing and everything tied to
          it like machine learning and ai which requires a lot of computing
          power to use which can be provided through cloud service providers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Just about everyone from businesses to individuals are affected by the
          improvements of cloud computing and they are affected in a good way.
          For business they can reduce costs by getting a third-party cloud
          service provider to host their servers and store all their data. They
          also save on space as they don’t need to keep massive servers on them.
          They also save on electricity as they don’t need as much hardware and
          eventually, they will be able to access virtual machines over the
          cloud which means there won’t be as much IT infrastructure and
          software installation done. A lot of tasks will be automated for them
          as Ai and Machine learning will be improved. Jobs such as data analyst
          will be done by computers instead of humans. Everyday consumers will
          have access to even faster cloud services, and they will get farm more
          storage options at an affordable price as the market is so
          competitive. However, some jobs may be made redundant through the
          advancement of cloud computing. Jobs such as administration will be
          automated and so there will be no need for any human interaction. It
          will be the same for data analyst as Ai will be able to do that job.
          Anything that involves processing information will be done through
          cloud services. Even package delivery will be done by drones and not
          humans and so some workers will have to adapt and learn how to use the
          drones to keep their job. But some jobs will be created by the
          improvement of the cloud. Jobs such as cloud administrator who manages
          the clouds infrastructure, Cloud Network Engineers maintain the cloud
          services on a companies’ network, and a cloud consultant who provide
          knowledge and guidance on companies looking to adopt certain types of
          cloud services. <br />
          <br />
          Cloud services is something that we all already use in our day to day
          lives. Services that we all use are email, Netflix, Spotify, YouTube,
          Amazon etc. I use cloud services nearly every day for entertainment. I
          use Netflix for movies and TV shows and Spotify for music and I use
          google drive to back up my work. I use canvas to gain access to my
          classes and all my work as well as to communicate with others. Pretty
          much every aspect of my life involves cloud service. I can’t fully
          rely on cloud services for everything as my internet is not as good as
          it’s always cutting out, so I am unable to use apps such as Microsoft
          office as I might lose my work if the internet cuts out. I can’t use
          the game streaming feature on the X Box Gamepass as the delay is
          massive. My brother collects DVDs as it's frustrating when the movie
          is buffering. All my family and friends use cloud services every
          single day. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t use YouTube and Netflix.
          My parents use cloud services whenever they use online banking or
          whenever they work from home. Most of use machine learning without
          even knowing, websites have ads that are tailored perfectly for us,
          and our phones can even learn our usage patterns and learn when to
          charge our phones and streaming services are always recommending
          movies for us. The data that is taken from us from websites and apps
          are all put in cloud servers for it to be studied later to find out
          more about what our interests is. Whether we know it or not cloud
          computing is a part of our everyday lives. It can be as big as YouTube
          and as small as texting family or friends.

        <h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Autonomous vehicles are those that are capable of sensing their
          environment and driving safely with little to no human input. They are
          developed with the main purpose of reducing accidents on roads and are
          aimed to be widely distributed to the public in the next few years.
          <br />
          <br />
          All standard Tesla vehicles include autopilot features. These cars are
          capable of suggesting routes for effective travel, and even
          automatically navigates the driver based on their destination. Users
          can summon their Tesla and it will navigate itself through the most
          complex of environments to meet them. These are just a few examples of
          tasks current autonomous vehicles are capable of, and is only a sneak
          peak of what they can be programmed to do in the future. <br />
          <br />
          Only if AVs (Autonomous Vehicles) have the ability to make decisions
          will they be deemed autonomous. Algorithms are the foundation of
          autonomous vehicle technology. An algorithm decides what to do when
          specific circumstances arise. For instance, when a person crosses the
          street, the algorithm must first recognise a moving item, then
          identify what it is, and last decide whether to slow down or guide the
          car in a different direction to prevent a collision. To accomplish
          this, the algorithm must be taught and programmed. People are in
          charge of programming the AV's fundamental rules; they determine what
          the AV will perform. The algorithm is trained using data and tested in
          actual scenarios to determine how well these rules work. The results
          are analyzed by people who adjust the algorithm so that it makes
          better decisions. <br />
          <br />
          Making moral choices will be necessary, for example, when deciding who
          will perish in a collision: the driver of the car or the pedestrian
          who was crossing the street (called self-sacrifice). How will an
          autonomous vehicle make the split-second decision to plough into a
          little toddler or two elderly folks at a high speed? Which of these
          lives is more valuable, and is it possible to train the algorithm to
          choose which one? We asked the programmers who are actively developing
          these algorithms how they would handle these circumstances. They said
          they wouldn't support rules requiring selflessness because they would
          discourage users and investors from purchasing autonomous vehicles.
          <br />
          <br />
          Security and the dependability of the AV systems are also crucial
          elements in deciding whether or not to accept AVs. Even if AVs might
          be safer, what will the economic and social repercussions be if a
          significant incident happens when numerous AVs are compromised?
          Additionally, system breakdowns, in which the computers or algorithms
          that power AVs stop working, may prevent people from operating a
          vehicle at all. It's vital to take into account the fact that society
          has criminal elements. Criminals might be able to hack into AV
          vehicles and seriously harm people and their property. Health and
          accident insurance would be impacted by each of these various
          scenarios. Who is accountable for paying for insurance? Who does that
          money protect? These questions would need to be rethought and new
          policies implemented before AVs can be introduced on any significant
          scale. <br />
          <br />
          AVs such as those being developed and tested by large organisations
          like Waymo and Tesla are currently at level 4 out of 5, meaning they
          are highly autonomous. Most of these vehicles are pending approval
          with innumerable regulations, and must of course pass many tests to
          ensure they will not pose any danger to drivers, other road users and
          the environment. It is expected that AVs at level 5 - fully autonomous
          - can be on roads as soon as three years from now, with some vehicles
          having no requirement for either a steering wheel or accelerator.
          <br />
          <br />
          What is the likely impact? Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the
          potential to have a tremendous influence on society by enabling
          driverless mobility for a very diverse group of individuals, including
          those who are now unable to drive due to physical, mental, or other
          impairments. Seniors, those with disabilities, and perhaps even young
          children would have easier access to independent commuting. Because
          there are less traffic congestion, AVs can significantly shorten
          travel times. Additionally, anyone travelling in the AV who don't
          drive can be productive while doing so because it is a much safer
          vehicle. Finally, users may use their phones without endangering
          others on the road or themselves! <br />
          <br />
          While many employment may change, many will also likely be lost since
          the transportation sector may no longer require human drivers. People
          who make a living driving cars, trucks, and buses may find themselves
          without employment if these vehicles begin to drive themselves. Next,
          think about all the managerial, support, and supervisory personnel
          employed by those drivers; these positions will likewise no longer be
          required. Jobs like taxi drivers may inevitably go away, but other
          positions like police officers may change since there won't be a need
          to issue tickets for speeding and parking. <br />
          <br />
          By enhancing how cars brake and accelerate, AV technology can decrease
          energy consumption while reducing emissions by 90%. The majority of
          driverless cars on the road today are already entirely electric.
          However, users would still be indirectly producing emissions if the
          car's battery charge isn't totally supplied by renewable energy,
          albeit significantly less so than a gasoline engine. When driving, AVs
          consume substantially less fuel and energy than a vehicle piloted by a
          human. When travelling at a high speed, braking heavily, then
          reaccelerating rapidly, the majority of the fuel is used. By
          eliminating these components from algorithms, programmers are reducing
          the amount of fuel burned, battery power used, and air pollution
          produced. <br />
          <br />
          How will this affect you? As AVs (Autonomous Vehicles) are expected to
          be safer than vehicles with human drivers, the chance of my family or
          friends getting into an accident will be reduced. Safety is always of
          importance in our lives. It’s always frustrating to see car accidents
          that occur from human drivers unable to pay attention to their
          surroundings, or are simply incapable of driving safely and according
          to the rules of the road. Use of AVs will avoid accidents influenced
          by these reasons and make the roads a safer place for everyone,
          including my family and friends. <br />
          <br />
          As a current student, the use of public transport is inevitably a part
          of my daily routine, whether it is to class, to friends, dinner or to
          get groceries. Additionally, I occasionally also drive my own vehicle
          to the station before further catching public transport. Public
          transport might become redundant, but that will be because AVs will
          become cheaper, safer in terms of less accidents, and also could be
          more comfortable in terms of privacy and hygiene. Autonomous vehicles
          could be a way to maintain economic activity in the event of a global
          pandemic while lowering the risk of viral transmission. <br />
          <br />
          As my parents and others around me get older, they will slowly lose
          the inability to drive in a manner which is safe for themselves and
          other road users. If AVs are widely introduced to the public, these
          people will not have so much of a restriction on their mobility if
          their driving abilities are a key factor in not being able to complete
          daily tasks and travel varying distances, to visit family on the other
          side of Melbourne for example. Besides, prices of fuel have soared
          over the past few months and don’t seem like they’ll return back to
          “normal” anytime soon. The lack of costs associated with AVs
          definitely appeals especially to those that need to travel long
          distances to work and family.
